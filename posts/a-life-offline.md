title: 'A life offline: some tips'

I've been living offline for the past few months (for various reasons), and would like to discuss how I've adapted and some tips and tricks I've picked up along the way.

## Youtube

If you're like me, you get a lot of news and content from Youtube. Once you go offline, you have to resort to guerilla tactics to get your yt fix. Also, let's face it: you really want to be alone when you watch 100 videos in a row of cats swatting at things, or whatever...there's no judgement in this place.

Check out [`youtube-dl`](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/). This little gem allows you to download a Youtube video directly to your device for later consumption.

## Free Places

Starbucks is always available, and like a lot of cafes, they provide free internet for their customers (although I feel like I need to keep drinking coffee while I'm there, so there's a time limit). There is also internet at my work, but it's at `work`. That seems to be all I do now days anyway, but still. I do use the free internet in the community area where I live quite a bit, and have found it to be decent.

## Focus

This brings up an issue I want to mention. What you are really paying for with a dedicated internet connection is an always on service that you can use in private. If you are like me, you like to focus and need breaks of solitude. For this reason, I don't really do intensive work in public.

So if you are skittish like me what do you do? One thing that worked for me was to write down the things I need to accomplish in a list like so:

1. check bank account to make sure check posted
2. push feature-xyz to Github
3. npm install some-package and bring up the docs in a browser
4. reply to so and so in Gmail

It's impossible to type a message of any length and really communicate in writing with someone using a cell, so I do the last one a lot.

I kind of liked this approach, since it forced me to focus on what I needed to get done.

## Conclusion

As of this writing, I now have home internet and have resumed consuming those succulent bytes. Doing without however, makes you realize what something really is. I grew up without internet, and know that even today you can live without it in your home. It *is* kind of boring, but it's not the end of the world.
