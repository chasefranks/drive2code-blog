# Redux is your friend

Ok, you're standing there waiting for the elevator. I want you to be thinking about Redux the next time.

## State

If you look at an elevator, it has state. The doors can be opened closed. It can also be on say 1 of 4 floors. It can also be in transit or at rest. We can bundle this state into an object like so

```js
{
  floor: 3,
  inTransit: false,
  doorsOpen: true
}
```
