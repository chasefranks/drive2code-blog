I've been using NextJS for the last 4 months now on a large scale migration project. My first foray into React has involved everything: server-side rendering (SSR), React hooks, Redux, SASS, etc. and having a framework like NextJS around has definitely made it easier.

I would like to start a series of short (hopefully) posts on NextJS and what I've learned so far. Some possible topics swirling around are:

* What is server-side rendering? 
* What is client-side routing?
* How does Redux fit in the SSR picture? How does my Redux state get from the server to the client so transparently?
* When to use Redux versus local state?

Thanks and stay tuned!
