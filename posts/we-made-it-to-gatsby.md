Welcome to the new blog, entirely redone in Gatsby!

I started my first [blog](https://chasefranks.github.io) in 2016 as a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) site hosted on Github pages. I loved learning about Jekyll, but to really gain control over your site you need to know some Ruby.

It's been an awesome journey to get here. I'm starting to get a lot of ReactJS work, and this exercise in Gatsby has been a great compliment to my learning. I decided early on to bootstrap this redesign from the default starter so I could build everything by hand, but there is a rich ecosystem of starter [templates](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/?v=2) to choose from.

 I'm also really enjoying the GraphQL integration...very nice!
