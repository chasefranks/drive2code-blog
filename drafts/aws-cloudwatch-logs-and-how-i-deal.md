excerpt: Let's face it, the UI for viewing logs in CloudWatch sucks. I'm going to tell you how I cope.

I've just started working with Amazon Web Services. A lot of my day-to-day work now involves the AWS Lambda service. There are a lot of lambdas floating around where I work. Since a lambda is a small piece of code that usually has one job to do, you're encouraged to have a lot of them. Each little lambda sends its logs into CloudWatch by default, so I have to spend some time there.

The UI is bad...very bad. It needs to be good, but it's not.
